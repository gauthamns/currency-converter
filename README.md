This is the app that was written during RVCE workshop. Just uploaded whatever was written during the time. Feel free to clone, modify, enhance and send me a pull request. RVCE ppl, lets make this the best currency app in the market.

For start, things that can be added:
Create a table for storing currencies that are supported.
Create a table for storing currency conversion.
Do calculations from the data obtained from table.
Periodically refresh the data from a website.

We can take up more as required.
